Wordify is a lightweight, offline desktop application that converts PDF files into editable Word documents with a clean, modern interface. Built with Python and Tkinter, it offers a simple two-page layout:
- A Convert page for selecting a PDF and initiating the conversion
- An About page displaying version info and update checks
Under the hood, Wordify uses PyMuPDF for fast, layout-aware text extraction and python-docx to generate .docx files. It’s designed for clarity, speed, and ease of use — no internet required.
